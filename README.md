# 🎉 MatchPoint - The Dating App That Puts Skin in the Game! 💸❤️

**MatchPoint** isn’t just another dating app—it’s where commitment meets fun, accountability, and a bit of healthy risk-taking! Say goodbye to endless ghosting and unfulfilled matches, and say hello to real connections with real people.

---

## 🌟 What Makes Us Different?

1. **💰 Pay to Swipe (Only $5!)**  
   Tired of meaningless swipes? At **MatchPoint**, it costs $5 to swipe "yes" on someone. This means you’ll only swipe on people you’re genuinely interested in!

2. **💘 Mutual Swipes Only**  
   The $5 only leaves your pocket if they swipe "yes" on you too! Matching has never been more intentional.

3. **⏳ Meet Within a Week**  
   Matches aren’t just for chatting—they’re for real-life dates. You and your match have **7 days** to meet in person, or both of you lose your money.

4. **📅 Set Your Availability**  
   Think of it like scheduling an interview, but way more fun! Once you match, add your availability and plan a time that works for both of you.

5. **🚫 No Excuses Allowed**  
   Ghosting? Terrible excuses? Forget it! If you back out, you lose your $5, and if it’s a pattern, you’re **banned**. No exceptions.

6. **📱 Tap to Confirm**  
   When you meet, simply tap your phones together (or scan a QR code) to verify your date. Both of you get your $5 refunded if you show up!

7. **💔 No-Show Fee**  
   If your match doesn’t show up, their $5 becomes yours. Call it karma—or just a great reason to follow through.

3. **It’s a Match!:**  
   Both swipe "yes"? Congrats! Now set your meeting availability and let the magic happen.

4. **Meet in Person:**  
   Plan the date, show up, and verify it via our app. Boom—you get your $5 back.
